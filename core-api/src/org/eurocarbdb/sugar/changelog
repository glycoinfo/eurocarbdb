rough changelog for sugar object merge:

General
-   all classes copied into package org.eurocarbdb.sugar
-   renamed variable names as per standard Java naming conventions
-   most GlycoconjugateExceptions changed to IllegalArgumentExceptions 
    (Glycoconjugate exceptions were only being thrown for errors in arguments anyway)

Molecule
-   merged with MassEntity, all references to MassEntity updated

Superclass 
-   changed all references to CAtoms to RingAtoms (since oxygen is 
    also in ring, not just carbon) (bugfix?)
-   added some doco

Monosaccharide
-   merged complementary methods.
-   added doco for most methods and attributes.
-   renamed getModificationList() to getModifications(), made returned list unmodifiable.
-   renamed getBaseTypeList() to getBaseTypes(), made returned list unmodifiable.
-   added setRingStart(int) & setRingEnd(int) methods
-   getGlycoctName(String) method moved to org.eurocarbdb.sugar.seq.GlycoctSequenceFormat
    class, since it's a sequence format-specific method
-   removed getModification(int) & getBasetype(int) methods, indexed access to
    list items can be obtained through getModifications() & getBaseTypes()

Modification
-   changed Integer arguments to int 
-   made modification name, position1 & position2 final

ModificationType
-   renamed UNKNOWN_BOUBLEBOND to UNKNOWN_DOUBLEBOND (typo)

SugarVisitor
-   remodelled into more Java-ish version using reflection to eliminate the need
    for "accept" methods.
-   made into an abstract class with default implementations of visit( XXX ).

Sugar
-   all "graph" operations moved into the Graph object member, accessible with getGraph().
-   renamed all incidences of 'Aglyca' to 'Aglycon' (typo - Aglyca is plural, Aglycon is the singular)
-   isConnected method moved to util.GraphUtils#isConnected accepting any Graph argument.
