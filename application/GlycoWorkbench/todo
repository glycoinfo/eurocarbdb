- Organisation of the workspace:
  - add two types of nodes Chromatography, Scan    
    - scan and chromatography are two experimental techniques

      - support for lc-ms/ms data, add multiple chromatograms as children of the MS chromatogram
            - the children scan are internally organized in a hierarchy
      - when clicking or accumulating the corresponding Scan are generated    
      	- accumulate on subscans as well
      - create chromatogram panel
	- double click on a peak show the corresponding spectra in the SpectraPanel
	- zoom/move
	- select a range of peaks 
	- combine selected peaks in a new spectra 
    - a SpectraDocument has only one ScanData and PeakData
      - redo spectra panel
    - upload of xml with more than one spectra, automatic sorting to tree in workspace
     - add new scan objects to the workspace for each LC or MS or MS/MS

- integration with HPLC

    - experimental technique has a modification strategy (fragmentation or enzymatic digestion)
    - a chromatography has two children

	- display using hiren's approach

- automatically check in the fragment editor if a peak is matched
	- highlight mass value with different color
	- add the fragment to annotation

- add multiple parents in the Antenna
	- the antenna residue can have multiple parents other than the bracket
		- you have getParent() and getPossibleParents();
	- when writing
		- collect a map with all the parents for each antenna
		- write a #n as a child of all the possible parents
		- write a #n as a parent of the antenna (always even if there are no parents)
	- when reading 
		- if #n is a child of a residue add it to the map of antenna/parents
		- if #n is a parent of a residue add all the collected parents  
	- create action for changing the parents of an antenna
		- use the ResidueSelectorDialog
	- import/export to GlycoCT
