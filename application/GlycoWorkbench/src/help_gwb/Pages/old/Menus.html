<p align="center">
All the actions to be performed in the GlycoWorkbench can be accessed
by the menus. Some of the commands are also replicated in the toolbar
for faster access. Some commands can be executed by pressing a
combination of keys, in this case the combination of keys to be
pressed is written next to the corresponding entry in the
menu. Finally, a popup menu with a reduced set of commands to be
performed on the selected residue(s) can be activated by pressing the
mouse right button. In the following, a command from the menu is
referenced as &quot;Menu name -> command name&quot;.
