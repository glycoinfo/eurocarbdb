<h1 align="center">Cut and Copy</h1>

<p align="center">
All the usual cut/copy/paste operations are implemented in the
GlycoWorkbench. The selected residues can be cut/copy from a location
and then pasted in a different location in the same window. If no
residues are selected when performing the &quot;paste&quot; action a
new structure will be created. The selection can also be pasted in a
different window of the GlycoWorkbench. The copied residues can be
pasted as an image in a graphic editor or Word document. The copied
residues can also be pasted as simple text (in the text notation used
by the GlycoWorkbench to represent structures) in a text window.
