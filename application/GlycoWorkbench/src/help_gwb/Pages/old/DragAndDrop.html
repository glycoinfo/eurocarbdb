<h1 align="center">Drag and Drop</h1>

<p align="center">
By pressing the mouse left button on a single residue or a group of
selected residues, the drag and drop mode is activated. The selected
residues can be dragged to any part of the drawing canvas. When the
mouse button is released the dragged residues will be moved to the
final location. If the button is released upon an existing residue,
the selection will be added to it, otherwise a new structure will be
created containing the selected residues. If the &lt;ctrl&gt; button
is pressed the selection will be copied from the original location to
its destination, otherwise the selected residues will be deleted from
the original location. The selection cannot be dragged outside the
current drawing canvas.
