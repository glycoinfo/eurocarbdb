<p align="center">
A single residue is selected by clicking the mouse left button on
it. If the &lt;ctrl&gt; button is pressed, the residues that are
already selected will remain in the same state, otherwise they will be
deselected. If the &lt;shift&gt; button is pressed all the residues on
the path between the last selection and the current one will be
selected as well. By pressing the mouse left button outside of any
residues and dragging it, the rectangle selection tool will be
activated. When the mouse button is released all the residues in the
rectangle area will be selected. If the &lt;ctrl&gt; button is
pressed, the residues that are already selected will remain in the
same state, otherwise they will be deselected. To select all residues
of all structures just press &gt;ctrl+A&lt; or go to &quot;Edit ->
Select all&quot;.
