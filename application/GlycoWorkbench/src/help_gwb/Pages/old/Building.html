<h1 align="center">Structure Building</h1>

<p align="center">
A glycan structure is built by adding new residues to the existing
ones. The residues are always added to the last selected residue. If
no residue is selected a new structure is created and the residue is
added to it. A residue can be inserted before the current selection by
clicking on &quot;Structure -> insert&quot; residue before or from the
corresponding entry in the popup menu. The type of the reducing end of
a structure can be changed by clicking on &quot;Structure -> change
reducing end type&quot;. In this way labels and markers can be added
to the structure. The mass of the marker is added to the total mass of
the structure. Fuzzy structures with uncertain antennae positions can
be created by adding a bracket to a structure. The antennae can then
be added to the structure by selecting the bracket.
