<h1 align="center">Fragmentation</h1>

<p align="center">
All the fragments of the selected glycan structure can be computed by
clicking in the menubar or in the popup menu on &quot;Tool ->
Fragments -> Compute fragments for all structures&quot;. The
fragment settings dialog will open. In the dialog there is the
possibility of chosing which type of fragments are computed and how
many cleavages are applied to the structure. After having pressed OK
in the fragment settings dialog, the fragment panel will appear in the
right part of the window. On the top of the panel it is displayed the
structure for which the fragments have been computed. The rest of the
panel is occupied by the fragments table. For each row of the fragment
table there are three columns: the fragment structure, the type of the
fragment and the mass of the fragment.
