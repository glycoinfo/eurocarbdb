;For a pulseprogram the first characters (usually up to 6, but 
;sometimes more) specify the type of experiment, e.g. DEPT, COSY,
;NOESY etc.. Further properties of the pulseprogram are 
;indicated by a two-character code, which is added to the name
;in alphabetical order. For 2D experiments the mode (absolute value,
;phase sensitive or echo-antischo) is always indicated. H- or X-
;decoupling is assumed to be default for heteronuclear experiments, 
;but not for homonuclear ones (except inad).
;In case of redundant information some two-character codes may be
;ommitted.
;
;The two-character codes used are the following:

ro     roesy

;Typical experiment names would be:
;   cosy, dept, dipsi2, hmbc, hmqc, hoesy, hsqc, inad, inept, 
;   mlev, noesy, roesy or trosy.


;Inverse correlations are denoted as hmbc, hmqc or hsqc.
;   Experiments with a BIRD sequence in the beginning
;   also contain a bi in the name.


;1D experiments, which are analogues of 2D experiments by virtue of
;   a selective pulse, start with sel.
;Semiselective 2D experiments have the same name as the unselective
;   version but with an s at the beginning:
;
;   scosyph <-> cosyph.


;A phase-sensitive (States-TPPI, TPPI etc.) NOESY experiment with 
;   presaturation would then be: 
;
;	noesy + ph + pr  =    noesyphpr.


;In the other direction the pulseprogram hmbcgplpndqf would be
;
;        hmbc + gp + lp + nd + qf
;
;	and therefor an:
;
;	inverse correlation for long-range couplings (HMBC) with
;           coherence selection using gradients with ":gp" syntax,
;           low-pass J-filter,
;           no decoupling
;           in absolute value mode.




;The nomenclature of parameters is described in Pulprog.info.
