<h1>Examples</h1>

<p>
  The installation file contains a folder named <em>examples</em> where
  you find some sample files to test the annotation features of the
  tool. In each sub-folder you will find sample structures together
  with their fragment peak lists. To test the annotation process just
  open the structure file inside GlycoWorkbench and load its
  corresponding peak list.
</p>
    
<h2>Set 1</h2>
<p>
    The structures and peak lists contained in this set have been
    retrieved from:
    
    <br/><br/>
    
    <em>Y. Mechref and M.V. Novotny,<strong>Structural Characterization of Oligosaccharides Using Maldi-TOF/TOF Tandem Mass Spectrometry</strong>, Analytical Chemistry, Volume <strong>75</strong>, Issue 18, 4895 - 4903, 2003.</em> 
</p>
<p>
  The peak lists have been obtained by running the underivatized
  structures trough a MALDI-TOF/TOF equipment. To obtain the same mass
  values the options "underivatized" and "Na+" ion must be selected in
  the <em>Mass options</em> dialog.
</p>

<h2>Set 2</h2>
<p>
    The structures and peak lists contained in this set have been
    retrieved from:
    <br/><br/>
    
    <em>E. Spina, L. Sturiale, D. Romeo, et al, <strong>New fragmentation

</p>

<h2>Set 3</h2>
<p>
    This set contains various structure files that show the display of
    different types of structures.
</p>
<h2>GAGs</h2>
<p>    
    This folder contains a workspace file showing a complete assignment
    of mass spectrometry data for a heparin oligosaccharide. A sample
    containing a mixture of dp10 oligosaccharide has been analysed by MS
    and MS/MS both in norharmane and ionic liquid. More details of the
    experimental setup can be found in.
