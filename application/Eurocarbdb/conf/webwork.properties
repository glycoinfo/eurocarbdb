### Load custom property files (does not override webwork.properties!)
# webwork.custom.properties=application,com/webwork/extension/custom

### How request URLs are mapped to and from actions
#
# mjh: since <action-name>.action looks and feels a bit clumsy we implement
# our own url-to-action mapping class, given below.
webwork.mapper.class=com.opensymphony.webwork.dispatcher.mapper.DefaultActionMapper
#webwork.mapper.class=org.eurocarbdb.action.mapper.UrlActionMapper

### Used by the DefaultActionMapper
### You may provide a comma separated list, e.g. webwork.action.extension=action,jnlp,do
webwork.action.extension=action


### when set to true, WebWork will act much more friendly for developers. This
### includes:
### - webwork.i18n.reload = true
### - webwork.configuration.xml.reload = true
### - raising various debug or ignorable problems to errors
###   For example: normally a request to foo.action?someUnknownField=true should
###                be ignored (given that any value can come from the web and it
###                should not be trusted). However, during development, it may be
###                useful to know when these errors are happening and be told of
###                them right away.
#webwork.devMode = false
webwork.devMode = true


### Configuration reloading
### This will cause the configuration to reload xwork.xml when it is changed
#webwork.configuration.xml.reload=false
webwork.configuration.xml.reload=true

webwork.log4j.configfile = log4j.properties
