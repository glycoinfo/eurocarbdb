<h4>
DMX DIGITAL FILTERS AND NON-BRUKER OFFLINE PROCESSING III</h4>

<center>W. M. Westler and F.&nbsp; Abildgaard
<br>July 16, 1996</center>

<p>The introduction of digital signal processing by Bruker in their DMX
consoles also introduced an unusual feature associated with the data. The
stored FID no longer starts at its maximum followed by a decay, but is
prepended with an increasing signal that starts&nbsp; from zero at the
first data point and rises to a maximum after several tens of data points.&nbsp;
On transferring this data to a non-Bruker processing program such as FELIX,
which is used at NMRFAM, the Fourier transform leads to an unusable spectrum
filled with wiggles.&nbsp; Processing the same data with Bruker's Uxnmr
program yields a correct spectrum.&nbsp; Bruker has been rather reluctant
to describe what tricks are implemented during their processing protocol.&nbsp;
They suggest the data should be first transformed in Uxnmr and then inverse
transformed, along with a GENFID command, before shipping the data to another
program. Bruker now supplies a piece of software to convert the digitally
filtered data to the equivalent analog form.
<p>&nbsp;We find it unfortunate that the vendor has decided to complicate
the simple task of&nbsp; Fourier transformation. We find that the procedure
suggested by Bruker is cumbersome, and more so, we are irritated since
we are forced to use data that has been treated with an unknown procedure.&nbsp;
Since we do not know any details of Bruker's digital filtration procedure
or the "magic" conversion routine that is used in Uxnmr, we have been forced
into observation and speculation.&nbsp; We have found a very simple, empirical
procedure that leads to spectra processed in FELIX that are identical,
within the noise limits, to spectra processed with Uxnmr.&nbsp; We deposit
this information here in the hope that it can be of some
<br>use to the general community.
<p>The application of a nonrecursive (or recursive) digital filter to time
domain data is accomplished by performing a weighted running average of
nearby data points.&nbsp; A problem is encountered at the beginning of
the data where, due to causality, there are no prior values.&nbsp; The
weighted average of the first few points, therefore, must include data
from "negative" time. One naive procedure, probably appropriate to NMR
data, is to supply values for negative time points is to pad the data with
zeros.&nbsp; Adding zeros (or any other data values) to the beginning of
the FID, however, shifts the beginning of the time domain data (FID) to
a later positive time.&nbsp; It is well known that a shift in the time
domain data is equivalent to the application of a frequency-dependent,
linear phase shift in the frequency domain.&nbsp; The 1st order phase shift
corresponding to a time shift of a single complex dwell point is 360 degrees
across the spectral width.&nbsp; The typical number of prepended points
found in DMX digitally filtered data is about 60 data points (see below),&nbsp;
the corresponding 1st order phase correction is ~21,000 degrees.&nbsp;
This large linear phase correction can be applied to the transformed data
to obtain a normal spectrum.&nbsp; Another, equivalent approach is to time
shift the data back to its original position. This results in the need
of only a small linear phase shift on the transformed data.
<p>There is a question as what to do with the data preceding the actual
FID.&nbsp; The prepended data can be simply eliminated with the addition
of an equal number of zeros at the end of the FID (left shift).&nbsp; This
procedure, however, introduces "frowns" (some have a preference to refer
to these as "smiles") at the edge of the spectrum.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the sweep
width is fairly wide this does not generally cause a problem.&nbsp; The
(proper) alternative is to retain this data by applying a circular left
shift of the data, moving the first 60 or so points (see recommendations
below) to the end of the FID. This is identical to a Fourier transformation
followed by the large linear phase correction mentioned above.&nbsp; The
resulting FID is periodic with the last of the data rising to meet the
first data point (in the next period).&nbsp; Fourier transform of this
data results in an approximately phased spectrum.&nbsp; Further linear
phase corrections of up to 180 degrees are necessary. A zero fill applied
after a circular shift of the data will cause a discontinuity and thus
introduce sinc wiggles on the peaks.&nbsp; The usual correction for DC
offset and apodization of the data, if not done correctly, also results
in the frowns at the edges of the spectrum.
<p>In our previous document on Bruker digital filters, we presented deduced
rules for calculating the appropriate number of points to be circular left
shifted. However, since then, newer versions of hardware (DQD) and software
has introduced a new set of values. Depending on the firmware versions
(DSPFVS) and the decimation rate (DECIM), the following lookup table will
give the circular shift values needed to correct the DMX data. The values
of DECIM and DSPFVS can be found in the acqus file in the directory containing
the data.

<p>The number of points obtained from the table are usually not integers.&nbsp;
The appropriate procedure is to circular shift (see protocol for details)
by the integer obtained from truncation of the obtained value and then
the residual 1st order phase shift that needs to be applied can be obtained
by multiplying the decimal portion of the calculated number of points by
360.
<p>For example,
<p>I<tt>f DECIM = 32, and DSPFVS = 10,</tt>
<br><tt>then #points 70.0156</tt>
<p>The circular shift performed on the data should be 70 complex points
and the linear phase correction after Fourier transformation is approximately
0.0156*360= 5.62 degrees.
<p>Protocol:
<ol>
<li>
Circular shift (rotate) the appropriate number of points in the data indicated
by the&nbsp; DECIM parameter. (see above formulae).</li>

<li>
After the circular shift, resize the data&nbsp; to the original size minus
the number of shifted points.&nbsp; This will leave only the part of the
data that looks like an FID.&nbsp; Baseline correction (BC) and/or apodization
(EM etc.) should be applied only on this data, otherwise "In come the frowns."&nbsp;
Since the first part of the data (the points that are shifted) represents
negative time, a correct apodization would also multiply the shifted points
by a negative time apodization.&nbsp; The data size is now returned to
its original size to reincorporate the shifted points.&nbsp; There may
still be a discontinuity between the FID portion and the shifted points
if thelast point of the FID portion is not at zero.&nbsp; This will cause
sinc wiggles in the peaks.</li>

<li>
Applying a zero fill to this data will lead to a discontinuity in the data
between the rising portion of the shifted points and the zero padding.&nbsp;
To circumvent this problem,&nbsp; the shifted points are returned (by circular
shift) to the front of the data, the data is zero filled, and then the
first points are shifted again to the end of the zero filled data.&nbsp;
4)&nbsp; The data can now be Fourier transformed and the residual calculated
1st order phase correction can be applied.</li>
